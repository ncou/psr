Chiron-Http
---------------

Strict PSR-7 implementation used by the Chiron Framework, but you may use it separately with any framework compatible with the PSR-7 standard.
It's a fork from Nyholm/psr7.

Come with the PSR-17 Factories.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install 
this library.

```bash
$ composer require chiron/http "^0.1"
```

This will install the `chiron/http` component and all required dependencies.
PHP 7.0, or newer, is required.

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Tests

To execute the test suite, you'll need phpunit.

```bash
$ phpunit
```
